### Thoughts
This was a nice step back into programming for me. The book is based around Python 2.x, so it took a little bit of Googling to figure out which statements and syntax had changed. Other than that, it was a fun, quick project. I always enjoy building games, and this was also a good opportunity to really understand the basics of Python.
